  /// 2 Nodes of a BST are swapped by mistake. Recover the BST by reverse swapping those swapped nodes.
  /// Solution: Since BST Inorder traversal gives elements in increasing order, we can traverse bst in inorder and look
  /// for nodes which violates the increasing order.
  /// We just have to find and swap the violating keys
  ///
  /// There can be 2 cases.
  /// Case 1: When adjucent nodes are swapped i.e. eg: 1,2,4,3,5,6
  /// In this case we get only one violation (3) and that and it's previous (4) needed to be swapped.
  /// i.e. swap 4 and 3 and we get 1,2,3,4,5,6
  ///
  /// Case 2: When non adjucent nodes are swapped i.e. eg: 1,6,3,4,5,2 {6 and 2 are swapped}
  /// Then first violation's = 3
  /// 2nd violation = 2
  /// Swap previous of first violation with 2nd violation
  /// and we get 1,2,3,4,5,6
